numbers1 = input("Kindly Input The First Digit Into The Terminal. ")

numbers2 = input ("Kindly Input The Second Digit Into The Terminal. ")

sum = int(numbers1) * int(numbers2)

print(numbers1, "Multiplied By", numbers2, "Is Equal To", sum)

#numbers1 Takes the Users Input And Stores It

#So Does numbers2

#Then The Sum variable storesconverts them both into integers ass the values of numbers1 and 2 are stored as strings

#Then Adds The Values Of Both The Integers And Stores the Total

#Then Finally Print Gives The Return Value Of Sum
