# FizzBuzz is a popular programming problem to test a developer's ability to think logically with code.

# The problem is simple but deceptive.

# Define a fizzbuzz function that accepts a single number as an argument. The function should print every number from 1 to that argument. 

# There are a couple caveats.

# If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

# If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

# If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, just print the number.

# Example: fizzbuzz(30)should print:

# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz
# 16
# 17
# Fizz
# 19
# Buzz

# 22

# def FizzBuzz (num1):
#     count = 1
#     while count <= num1:
#         if count % 3 == 0 and count % 5 == 0:
#             print("FizzBuzz")
#         elif count % 5 == 0:
#             print("Buzz")
#         elif count % 3 == 0:
#             print("Fizz")
#         else:
#             print(count)
#         count += 1
            
FizzBuzz(30)
# def factorial(num1):
#     apple = num1
#     procces = 1
#     if apple >= procces:
#         print(apple)
#     if apple == procces:
#         return
#     factorial(num1 - 1)
# factorial(100)
