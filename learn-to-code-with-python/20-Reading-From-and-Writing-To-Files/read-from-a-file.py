# The with operator closes a file once the block of code is run

# But there is still a open() function that takes the file name - as a string - and Character
    # Meaning

    # 'r'

    # open for reading (default)

    # 'w'

    # open for writing, truncating the file first

    # 'x'

    # open for exclusive creation, failing if the file  already exists

    # 'a'

    # open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists

    # 'b'

    # binary mode

    # 't'

    # text mode (default)


    # '+'

# open for updating (reading and writing)"

# And a close method that takes no arguments

# Then there is a .Read() method
